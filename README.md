# Sentiment-analysis-using-Pyspark-LSTM

## Description:
This GitHub repository contains a Jupyter notebook summarizing a sentiment analysis project using PySpark, a powerful tool for big data processing. The project focuses on sentiment analysis of tweets using the `sentiment140` dataset.<br>

The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use PySpark for sentiment analysis, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building. It showcases how to create word embeddings using word2vec, a popular word embedding technique, and how to feed these embeddings into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, along with a neural network layer for binary classification of tweets into positive or negative sentiment categories.<br>
## Results:
In the project, the results of sentiment analysis using PySpark were promising, with an AUC score of 0.7983 and an accuracy of 71.77%. The AUC score indicates that the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative tweets is relatively good, with a higher score indicating better performance.<br> 
The accuracy of `71.77%` suggests that the model is able to correctly classify approximately 72% of the tweets into their respective sentiment categories. These results indicate that the LSTM model, combined with word2vec embeddings and neural network layers, is capable of effectively capturing sentiment information from tweets.<br>
However, further optimizations and improvements can be explored to potentially enhance the model's performance and achieve even higher accuracy and AUC scores.
